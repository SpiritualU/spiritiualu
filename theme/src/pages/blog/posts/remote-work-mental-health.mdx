On the occasion of SoulBlog's inaugural article, I would like to stress the importance of faith in any spiritual endeavor. Faith is that which keeps us going during hard times, times when you feel like you cannot make it. Roadblocks will inevitably happen during a spiritual journey, and those who overcome them have a deep-rooted belief that cannot be surmounted by any obstacle. Faith serves as a foundational component of any religion and without it, one cannot progress further. After all, with what inspiration can one follow a path when they do not trust that they are going to the right place? 

The 15th century poet-saint Kabir, whose philosophical ruminations have influenced most of the major world religions, speaks on this matter through his poem "Moko Kahan Dhunde Re Bande" (Where do you search for me, O friend?). In the following stanzas, Kabir says that he is not in prayers, austerities, vows, fasts, pilgrimage places, holy rivers, etc. Thus the question arises in any reader's mind: where is he? Kabir responds with a simple answer in the final stanza.

> Kahat Kabira, sun bhai sadho  

> Main toh hun vishwas mein

Kabir says: Listen O friend,      

Wherever your faith is, there I am.

An extremely powerful message, which is also mentioned in the Bible. In Luke 17:20-21, the Pharisees ask Jesus when the kingdom of God will come? Jesus responds, "People will not say 'here it is!' or 'there it is!' because God's kingdom is within you". This works with anything in life. If you believe that you will attain a goal, you will. 

There have been many studies in the medical world examining the "placebo effect". Patients suffering from intense pain were given sugar water and were told it was a painkiller. Surprisingly enough, the "fake" treatment showed wonders and all the patients reported that they felt less pain. There was no magic in the sugar water, only in the patients' brains. The power lies not in the "treatment", but in the patients' belief that it would work. The same concept can be applied to spirituality. The key to spiritual growth lies not in the austerities, fasting, and prayer, but in the belief that there is an Almighty who will reward your worship. 

In conclusion, have faith. Believe that you are on a spiritual journey. Trust in the process, and that it will ultimately better your life. Trust that you are improving your quality of life. Trust that you will find inner peace. Trust in your own skills and capabilities. Trust in a higher power, whatever that may constitute for you, that will reward your efforts. Above all, trust in the power of faith. Because without it, all your attempts at growth will be in vain.
