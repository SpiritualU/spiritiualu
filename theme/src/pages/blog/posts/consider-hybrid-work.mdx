Life is a beautiful thing. One moment. One mere second in time, can mark the end of a journey while another starts. The obstacles that consume us on a day to day basis can often seem overwhelming and create a surge of sudden emotions, yet despite these emotions we continue to persereve. We continue the routine. We continue the cycle. We continue to exectue. Often the normality of our daily lives make little things appear much greater than what they really are. Whether its the frustration of not recieving a promotion despite putting your all into that particular job, or not achieving a goal that you have been working towards for months, these "challenges" create feelings of doubt and spite. The feeling of being a shadow, the feeling of being unnoticed.
